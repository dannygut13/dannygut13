    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Daniel. I am both a technician and a college student, juggling the challenges of real-world 
        technical work while striving to earn my degree. As a technician, I troubleshoot complex systems and ensure 
        that everything operates smoothly. At the same time, as a student, I am constantly learning and applying new 
        concepts, which can sometimes feel overwhelming. However, overcoming these challenges has made me more resilient.
    </p>
    <p>
        Balancing work and study is not always easy, but it's a rewarding experience. The technical skills I develop 
        in my career often complement my academic knowledge, and vice versa. Despite the pressures, I remain determined 
        to excel in both areas, constantly pushing myself to grow and improve. I know that every challenge I face today 
        will help me build a better future.
